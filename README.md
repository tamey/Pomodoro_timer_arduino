# Pomodoro_timer_arduino
This is a code for pomodoro timer using Arduino
This pomodoro timer is 25 min timer that displays the time when timer is running on the 7 segment display using a bcd to 7 segment decoder IC-7447
In the circuit I have used a Arduino pro mini(5v,16Mhz) , two common anode 7 segment displays, a press button and a buzzer.
After 25 min are over the buzzer gives sound for 5 secs and immediately after that 5 min timer for break period is initiated.
After 1 pomodori is over then for starting next pomodori one has to press button again
